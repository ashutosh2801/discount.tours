         <p>The biggest advantage of staying at Ambiance by the Falls is its proximity to all the tourist areas. Most of the sights are at a walkable distance.</p>

<p>This property is located in a quiet residential area. It is near Clifton Hill (10 minutes' walk), yet distant enough that you are not disturbed by the hustle and bustle of the tourist area.</p>

<p>Amenities in the room include a TV, air conditioning, free WiFi and private bathroom. There is free parking at the rear of the house.</p>

<p>All the areas are non-smoking. Freshly prepared breakfast is served every morning consisting of coffee, fresh fruit, yogurt, eggs, bacon, breads, muffins and jam. Fresh brewed coffee and tea are available all day.</p>

<p>Bird Kingdom, Fallsview Indoor Waterpark, and Clifton Hill are just a 10-15 minute walk from the B&B. The WEGO bus shuttle to the tourist area stops just a block away, making it convenient for guests to reach the Falls area.</p>

<p>Many restaurants and markets in the area!</p>

More importantly, they offered the ability to fly out, see the falls, and be back in the city again within the space of two hours-- you can\\\'t beat that efficiency for a short visit!\r\n\r\nFrom the first moment you see the classic 1960s airplane, to the moment you\\\'re drifting over Horseshoe Falls, every part of the tour was unforgettable. This wasn\\\'t just another helicopter tour, which there are dozens of for various attractions, but a fantastic little aircraft, which has been lovingly preserved-- during the tour, the pilot even told me how he used it the week prior to pick his mother up from all the way over in the US-- to the onboard commentary about what you\\\'re seeing outside the window as you go along the shore of Lake Ontario and over Niagara Falls itself, every moment was magical, and well worth the money.\r\n\r\nIt may sound expensive at first, but when you factor in the ground transport it would take to get out to the falls for a helicopter tour, the airplane tour is well worth it, especially when you also factor in the advantage of being able to go directly out of Toronto itself, leaving more time to explore the city itself should you be on a tight schedule like I was.

It is a little hard to be warm and fuzzy when it is so loud and windy and the crew has headphones on, so I don\\\'t know why people are dinging them for politeness. I thought they were great, and I really appreciated the flexibility of being able to show up when we wanted to.

We have furnished our distillery with a variety of equipment that will allow us to run it as a full on 'spirit' laboratory. Many spirit companies focus on producing a few or even a single type of alcohol that is often ‘neutral’ tasting. Limited Distilling will place emphasis on exploring a variety of products while embracing the uniqueness and characteristics of each batch. Our spirit runs will often be small allowing us to explore the use of different ingredients, both local and from around the world. We look forward to sharing with you our exciting variety of spirit creations.<br><br><br><br>Duration: 45 minutes<br><br><b>Stop At:</b> The Exchange Brewery, 7 Queen Street, Niagara-on-the-Lake, Ontario L0S 1J0 Canada<br><br>The Exchange is a new premium brewery and tasting room located in Niagara-on-the-Lake’s Old Town heritage district. Although the town is known as the heart of Ontario’s wine country, it is also the scene of a burgeoning craft-brewing industry. With brewing and agricultural roots that stretch back to the late 1700s, Niagara-on-the-Lake is the perfect home for The Exchange’s approach to brewing, which blends traditional and modern techniques and equipment.<br><br>We focus on making exceptional craft beers using only the highest quality ingredients, including local Niagara fruits. Our selection includes a range of American styles along with sour and funky Belgian-style beers and ales.<br><br>Duration: 45 minutes<br><br><b>Stop At:</b> Konzelmann Estate Winery, 1096 Lakeshore Rd, Niagara-on-the-Lake, Ontario L0S 1J0 Canada<br><br>Konzelmann is Niagara’s only lakefront winery, located on the shores of Lake Ontario. The Winery began in the small German town of Uhlbach, near the turn of the 19th century. A restauranteur named Friederich Konzelmann left the culinary trade to pursue the craft of winemaking. Bolstered from previous success in producing house wines for his restaurants, Friederich officially released his first vintage to the public in 1893. He would eventually produce 200,000 litres of excellent wine per year from an array of Germany’s celebrated aromatic varietals.<br><br><br>Duration: 45 minutes<br><br><b>Stop At:</b> Ironwood Cider House | Sunnybrook Farm, 1425 Lakeshore Rd, Niagara-on-the-Lake, Ontario L0S 1J0 Canada<br><br>Ironwood Cider House is the destination for community and cider enthusiasts alike. We invite guests to taste, connect, and experience the world of cider and curated local contemporary artwork. Located in the heart of Niagara-on-the-Lake and on route to the downtown core, the cider house is the perfect stop to explore, learn, and stay a while. <br><br>Duration: 45 minutes<br><br></p>]]></Introduction>

We want to challenge the boundaries of Niagara winemaking and offer our guests and drinkers a dynamic experience. Regardless of what is going on at the winery, the best part of my day is taking visitors on tour of our property and walking them through a wine tasting. The looks on their faces when they taste that one wine they’ve been looking for is what makes this all worth it.<br><br>Duration: 1 hour<br><br></p>]]></Introduction>

Sir Adam Beck Generating Station I, Sir Adam Beck Generating Station II and the Sir Adam Beck Pump Generating Station are all owned by Ontario Power Generation. Following the development of several smaller generating stations around Niagara Falls in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, the Province of Ontario authorized the construction of first major publicly owned generating station in the province.[1] At the time it was built, it was the largest hydroelectric generating station in the world.<br><br>The stations divert water from the Niagara and Welland rivers above Niagara Falls which is then released into the lower portion of the Niagara River, and together produce up to 1,997 MW (2,678,000 hp).<br><br>Duration: 3 minutes<br><br><b>Pass By:</b> Niagara River Recreation Trail, Paralleling the Niagara River Fort George to Fort Erie, Niagara-on-the-Lake, Ontario Canada<br><br>The Niagara River (/naɪˈæɡərə/ ny-AG-ər-ə) is a river that flows north from Lake Erie to Lake Ontario. It forms part of the border between the province of Ontario in Canada (on the west) and the state of New York in the United States (on the east). There are differing theories as to the origin of the river's name. According to Iroquoian scholar Bruce Trigger, Niagara is derived from the name given to a branch of the locally residing native Neutral Confederacy, who are described as being called the Niagagarega people on several late-17th-century French maps of the area.[3] According to George R. Stewart, it comes from the name of an Iroquois town called Ongniaahra, meaning "point of land cut in two".[4]<br><br>The river, which is occasionally described as a strait,[5] is about 58 kilometres (36 mi) long and includes Niagara Falls in its course. The falls have moved approximately 11 kilometres (6.8 mi) upstream from the Niagara Escarpment in the last 12,000 years, resulting in a gorge below the falls. Today, the diversion of the river for electrical generation has significantly reduced the rate of erosion.<br><br><b>Stop At:</b> Niagara-on-the-Lake, Niagara-on-the-Lake, Ontario<br><br>Niagara-on-the-Lake is a town in Ontario, Canada. It is located on the Niagara Peninsula at the point where the Niagara River meets Lake Ontario, across the river from New York, United States. Niagara-on-the-Lake is in the Niagara Region of Ontario, and is the only town in Canada that has a Lord Mayor.[3] It has a population of 17,511 (2016).<br><br>Niagara-on-the-Lake is important in the history of Canada: it served as the first capital of the Province of Upper Canada, the predecessor of Ontario, called Newark from 1792 to 1797. During the War of 1812, the town, the two former villages of St. David's and Queenston, and Fort George were the site of numerous battles following the American invasion of Upper Canada, and the town was razed. Niagara-on-the-Lake is home to the oldest Anglican and Catholic churches in Ontario, and the oldest surviving golf course in North America.<br><br>Duration: 2 minutes<br><br><b>Stop At:</b> The Welland Canal, West Street, Welland, Ontario L3K 4E3 Canada<br><br>The Welland Canal is a ship canal in Ontario, Canada, connecting Lake Ontario and Lake Erie. It forms a key section of the St. Lawrence Seaway and Great Lakes Waterway. Traversing the Niagara Peninsula from Port Weller to Port Colborne, it enables ships to ascend and descend the Niagara Escarpment and bypass Niagara Falls.<br><br>The fourth iteration of a canal around the Falls, the Welland passes about 3,000 ships which transport about 40,000,000 tons of cargo a year. It was a major factor in the growth of the city of Toronto, Ontario.[citation needed] The original canal and its successors allowed goods from Great Lakes ports such as Cleveland, Detroit, and Chicago, as well as heavily industrialized areas of the United States and Ontario, to be shipped to the port of Montreal or to Quebec City, where they were usually reloaded onto ocean-going vessels for international shipping.<br><br>The Welland Canal eclipsed other, narrower canals in the region, such as the Trent-Severn Waterway and, significantly, the Erie Canal (which linked the Atlantic and Lake Erie via New York City and Buffalo, New York) by providing a shorter, more direct connection to Lake Erie.<br><br>Duration: 2 minutes<br><br></p>]]></Introduction>

The Dufferin Islands are truly one of Niagara’s best hidden gems. <br><br>After your walk through the Islands, your guide will take you on a stroll along the Niagara Parkway to view famous Niagara landmarks including the Old Scow, Upper Rapids, the power stations, the Illumination Tower and of course, the Niagara Falls themselves. <br><br>At the end of your tour, your guide will bring you to the Hornblower loading area in the heart of Niagara’s tourism district. If you’ve chosen to take part in the cruise, you will continue onward to a refreshing, socially-distanced boat ride into the mist. For guests not taking part in the cruise, you may continue exploring the beautiful city of Niagara Falls on your own. <br><br>]]></ProductText>
